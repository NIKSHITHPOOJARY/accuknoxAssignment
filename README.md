# System Health Monitor and Automated Backup Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to help with system health monitoring and automated backup

## System Health Monitor

The `system_health_monitor.py` script monitors the health of a Linux system. It checks CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the script sends an alert to the console or a log file.
